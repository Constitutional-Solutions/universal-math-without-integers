# Datasets Folder

This folder contains datasets, simulation logs, and templates for the Universal Math Without Integers project.

## Contents

### Core Files
- **reference-patterns.csv**: Core mathematical, geometry, and relation patterns for recovery and simulation
- **simulation-log-template.md**: Step-by-step log and verification template for simulations
- **geometry-simulations.csv**: Example geometric simulation data demonstrating pattern flows
- **resonance-fields.csv**: Sample frequency and resonance data for pattern analysis
- **variable-less-examples.md**: Examples of pattern and flow systems without variables or indices

## Usage

### For Peer Review
These datasets provide standardized formats and example data for peer review processes. Each file contains starter entries that demonstrate the expected data structure and content format.

### For Restoration
The reference patterns and templates serve as restoration points for mathematical concepts expressed through flow-based rather than variable-based approaches.

### For Simulation
Use the simulation log template to document step-by-step processes. The example datasets provide sample data structures for various types of mathematical and geometric simulations.

## Data Formats

- **CSV files**: Contain structured data with headers describing each field
- **Markdown files**: Provide templates and examples with documentation
- All files are designed to be human-readable and version-control friendly

## Contributing

When adding new datasets:
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Include appropriate headers and documentation
3. Provide example entries to demonstrate usage
4. Update this README with descriptions of new files
