# Seed: L-System Grove

Overview
- String-rewrite procedural growth for trees, coral, and symbolic grammars.

Parameters
- axiom, rules[], iterations, angle, step, randomness, wind_noise, thickness_decay

Outputs
- Vector/mesh, growth timeline, metrics: branching factor, coverage, symmetry, curvature energy.

LES Hooks
- Resonance: form-frequency harmony vs. frequency module
- Reciprocity: habitat disturbance and cooperative growth index
- Reversibility: prune/rollback steps, regeneration budget
- Dignity safeguard: symbol filters and cultural motifs review

Procedures
- Define grammar; simulate with wind/noise; export SVG/canvas.
- Snapshot at iterations; Fork different rule sets; Remix angle/step schedules.
