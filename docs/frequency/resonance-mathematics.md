### Core Philosophy
All mathematical relationships can be understood as resonance patterns—harmonious vibrations that create stable structural configurations. From basic arithmetic to advanced calculus, mathematics emerges from the interplay of frequencies, creating interference patterns that manifest as geometric forms, algebraic structures, and analytical functions.

## Fundamental Frequency Concepts

- **Fractals**: Self-similar resonance patterns across frequency scales

#### Vibrational Topology
- **Resonance Modes**: Standing wave patterns defining geometric shapes
- **Frequency Domains**: Different oscillation rates creating distinct geometric regions
- **Harmonic Boundaries**: Interface regions between different resonance zones
