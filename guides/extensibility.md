# Extensibility and Community Challenges

This document invites new frameworks, adapters, and empirical challenges to grow the universal-math-without-integers ecosystem.

## 1. How to Extend
- New relation types and invariants (submit specs and examples)
- New generators and simulators (add to protocols/algorithms)
- New domain adapters (geometry, audio, networks, cognition)
- Visualization and analysis tools

## 2. Proposal Template
Include:
- Motivation and theoretical mapping (geometry/math/frequency)
- Formal specification (data schemas, operations, invariants)
- Reference implementation (language-agnostic pseudocode + one language)
- Datasets and tests (place in /datasets, document in /docs)
- Evaluation criteria and limitations

## 3. Empirical Challenges
Propose measurable, falsifiable challenges:
- Cymatics: reproduce pattern-frequency mapping tables
- Planetary: test resonance ratios across systems
- Biological: growth spirals and branching ratios
- Social: phase locking in coordination dynamics

Provide ground truth references and target metrics for replication.

## 4. Governance and Review
- Use issues and pull requests with clear tags: proposal, dataset, algorithm, invariant
- Require at least one reproducer before merging
- Encourage counterexamples and negative results

## 5. Code of Conduct and Ethics
- Respect contributors and diverse perspectives
- Separate speculation from evidence
- Ensure reproducibility and data licensing

## 6. Roadmap Labels
- draft, ready-for-review, needs-dataset, needs-replication, accepted, deferred

Join us in making relation, emergence, and resonance research auditable, extensible, and empirically grounded.
